Read plan file\n2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan\n3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting\n4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed\n\n### Step 2: Execute Batch\n**Default: First 3 tasks**\n\nFor each task:\n1. Mark as in_progress\n2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)\n3. Run verifications as specified\n4. Mark as completed\n\n### Step 3: Report\nWhen batch complete:\n- Show what was implemented\n- Show verification output\n- Say: \"Ready for feedback.\"\n\n### Step 4: Continue\nBased on feedback:\n- Apply changes if needed\n- Execute next batch\n- Repeat until complete\n\n### Step 5: Complete Development (Autonomous)\n\nAfter all tasks complete and verified:\n\n1. **Verify tests pass:**\n   ```bash\n   # Run project's test suite\n   npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...\n   ```\n   If tests fail: Fix issues, re-run. Do NOT proceed until tests pass.\n\n2. **Commit all changes:**\n   ```bash\n   git add -A\n   git commit -m \"feat: [descriptive message]\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Push branch:**\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin HEAD\n   ```\n\n4. **Create Pull Request:**\n   ```bash\n   gh pr create --title \"[Feature Title]\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   ## Summary\n   - [Bullet points of what was implemented]\n\n   ## Test Plan\n   - All tests pass\n   - [Any specific verification steps]\n\n   Generated with Claude Code\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Merge the PR:**\n   ```bash\n   gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch\n   ```\n\n6. **Cleanup worktree (if applicable):**\n   ```bash\n   # If in a worktree, remove it\n   git worktree list | grep $(pwd) && cd .. && git worktree remove <worktree-path>\n   ```\n\n## When to Stop and Ask for Help\n\n**STOP executing immediately when:**\n- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)\n- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting\n- You don't understand an instruction\n- Verification fails repeatedly\n- Tests fail after multiple fix attempts\n\n**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**\n\n## When to Revisit Earlier Steps\n\n**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**\n- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback\n- Fundamental approach needs rethinking\n\n**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.\n\n## Remember\n- Review plan critically first\n- Follow plan steps exactly\n- Don't skip verifications\n- Reference skills when plan says to\n- Between batches: just report and wait\n- Stop when blocked, don't guess\n- Tests MUST pass before PR creation\n- Automatically merge PR at the end\n\n## Key Difference from executing-plans\n\nThis skill does NOT use the finishing-a-development-branch skill. Instead, it automatically:\n1. Creates PR\n2. Merges with --squash --delete-branch\n3. Cleans up worktree\n\nNo user interaction required for the final steps.\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"fdf42fa5-814c-5749-800f-2e7fc7d14681","uuid":"c01aeda5-bfbe-47c2-b33a-62371065744a","isSynthetic":true}

Each task has numbered steps — execute them in order. Every step that says \"Run\" means execute the command and verify the output matches. The workspace must compile with `cargo check --workspace` after every task.\n\n**Goal:** Initialize the complete Cargo workspace with all 8 crate stubs, git repository, configuration files, submodules, and CLAUDE.md so that `cargo check --workspace` passes on an empty but structurally valid project.\n\n**Architecture:** Cargo workspace at the root with 8 member crates under `crates/`. Each crate has a `Cargo.toml` and `src/lib.rs` stub. The workspace uses a shared dependency table (`[workspace.dependencies]`) for version consistency. Git submodules link to external XML schemas and test data.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Rust 2021 edition, Cargo workspace, git submodules\n\n---\n\n## Task 1: Initialize Git Repository and Workspace Root\n\n**Files:**\n- Create: `Cargo.toml` (workspace root)\n- Create: `.gitignore`\n- Create: `rustfmt.toml`\n- Create: `clippy.toml`\n\n**Step 1: Write the failing test**\n\nNo test for this task — this is project scaffolding.
